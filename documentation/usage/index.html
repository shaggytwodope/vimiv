    <h1>Usage</h1>

    <a name="getting_started"><h4>Getting started</h4></a>

    <p>
    You can start vimiv from any application launcher with its .desktop file or
    from the command line using the <code>vimiv</code> command. If any valid
    image paths are given, the images are opened directly, otherwise the library
    is opened.
    </p>

    <p>
    To close vimiv press <code>q</code>, <code>^q (Control+q)</code> or type in
    <code>:q</code> in the command line.
    </p>

    <p>
    Vimiv is, as one would expect from an application with vim-like keybindings,
    completely keyboard driven. To get you started some of the most important
    keybindings for controlling vimiv are listed below. For a complete list of
    them check out the
    <a href="../keybindings">keybinding</a> documentation.
    </p>

    <a name="image"><h4>Image</h4></a>

    <p>
    Scrolling the image is done with <code>hjkl</code>. The next image is
    selected with <code>n</code>, the previous one with <code>p</code>. To show
    the first/last image use <code>g/G</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Zooming in and out is done with <code>+/-</code>. To fit the image to the
    current window size use <code>w</code>. <code>e/E</code> fit
    horizontally/vertically.
    </p>

    <a name="library"><h4>Library</h4></a>

    <p>
    The behaviour of the library is similar to the one of the file manager
    <a href="http://ranger.nongnu.org/">ranger</a>.
    You can scroll down/up with <code>j/k</code>. <code>g/G</code> select the
    first/last file in the list.  <code>h</code> opens the parent directory
    while <code>l</code> selects the current file. If the file is a directory,
    it is opened in the library. An image is displayed to the right of the
    library.  Pressing <code>l</code> again closes the library and focuses the
    image.
    </p>

    <p>
    Toggle the library with <code>o</code>, toggle focus between the library and
    the last other widget with <code>O (Shift+o)</code>.
    </p>


    <a name="thumbnail"><h4>Thumbnail</h4></a>

    <p>
    Thumbnail mode is toggled with <code>t</code>. As always <code>hjkl</code>
    and <code>g/G</code> work as expected.
    </p>

    <p>
    It is also possible to vary the size of the thumbnails with the
    <code>+/-</code> keys.
    </p>

    <a name="image_editing"><h4>Image editing</h4></a>

    <p>
    Images can be rotated with the <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>,
    flipped with the <code>|</code> and <code>_</code> keys. These changes are
    automatically applied to the file. An image is deleted with <code>x</code>.
    This actually moves the image to the trash directory specified by the
    freedesktop standard, by default
    <b class="filename">$XDG_DATA_HOME/Trash</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
    For additional editing open manipulate mode with <code>c</code>. Here
    brightness, contrast and sharpness can be edited. To focus the respective
    slider use the <code>bcs</code> keys. To apply the changes accept with
    <code>Return</code>, to leave manipulate mode reverting any changes press
    <code>Escape</code>.
    </p>

    <a name="commandline"><h4>Command line</h4></a>

    <p>
    Similar to many keyboard centric programs, vimiv includes a simple commmand
    line to run commands. It is opened with <code>:</code> and closed with
    <code>Return</code> to run a command and <code>Escape</code> to discard it.
    </p>

    <p>
    When entering the command line a completion window for vimiv's commands is
    displayed. Pressing <code>Tab</code> completes to the best match if there is
    one, continuing to press <code>Tab</code> cycles through the completions.
    </p>

    <p>
    Entering <code>~</code>, <code>./</code>, or <code>/</code> at the beginning
    of the command line lets vimiv interpret the command as a path. A valid
    directory/image is opened in the library/image. Completing paths is
    also supported.
    </p>

    <p>
    Prepending a command with <code>!</code> lets vimiv interpret the command as
    an external command. The following text is passed to the shell. Here
    <code>%</code> is replaced with the currently selected file and
    <code>*</code> with the current file list.</br>
    Example: <code>:!gimp %</code> 
    opens the currently selected image in gimp.
    </p>

    <p>
    External commands can be "piped to vimiv" by appending the <code>|</code>
    char to the command. The output of the command is then parsed by vimiv. If
    the first line out output is a directory, it is opened in the library. If it
    is a valid image, all lines are checked for images and these are opened.
    Otherwise vimiv will try to run an internal command from the output.</br>
    Example: <code>:!find ~/Images -ctime -5 -type f |</code> 
    opens all files in ~/Images younger than five days.
    </p>

    <p>
    To search through open files open the command line with <code>/</code>. Per
    default this searches through the names incrementally and case-sensitively
    but this can be changed in the configuration file.
    </p>

    <p>
    Command line history is saved to
    <b class="filename">$XDG_DATA_HOME/vimiv/history</b>.
    History can be navigated and searched through using the <code>^P/^N</code>
    and <code>Up/Down</code> keys.
    </p>

    <p>
    Some commands support passing a [count] as repeat or step. If so, prepend
    [count] to the command, e.g. <code>:5next</code>.
    </p>

    <a name="mark_tag"><h4>Marks and tags</h4></a>

    <p>
    Images are marked with <code>m</code>. To remove the mark from a marked
    image simply press <code>m</code> again. <code>M</code> will toggle the mark
    status: If any images are marked, the marks are cleared, otherwise the last
    list of marked images is marked again. To quickly mark a bunch of images the
    <code>:mark_between</code> command is useful. It marks all images between
    the last two marked images.
    </p>

    <p>
    If images are marked, the simple manipulations (rotating, flipping and
    deleting) are executed for all marked images and not for the current image.
    In thumbnail mode those actions will always apply to marked images. To save
    a list of marked images, vimiv has a simple tag system.
    </p>

    <p>
    <code>:tag_write tagname</code> saves the list of currently marked images to
    a file saved in <b class="filename">$XDG_DATA_HOME/vimiv/Tags/tagname</b>.
    If the file doesn't exist, it will be created. If it does, the names will
    be appended to it, if they aren't in the tagfile already.</br>
    <code>:tag_load tagname</code> loads all images in the tagfile tagname.</br>
    <code>:tag_remove tagname</code> deletes the tagfile tagname.
    </p>
